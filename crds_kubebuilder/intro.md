# Welcome to Building a Custom Resource with Kubebuilder

In this lab, you'll learn how to use [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) to create a custom resource and controller in Kubernetes. We'll build a simple "Task" resource to manage automated tasks in a cluster, exploring key concepts like CRD creation, spec/status definition, and validation.

By the end, you'll:
- Set up a Kubebuilder project.
- Define a custom resource with a spec and status.
- Add validation rules using markers.
- Deploy and test your custom resource.

Letâ€™s get started!
