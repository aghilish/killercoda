# Welcome to Building a Kubernetes Operator for MCP Servers

In this comprehensive lab, you'll learn to build a production-ready Kubernetes operator for managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This tutorial combines three essential areas:

**Part 1: MCP Fundamentals** - Understanding the Model Context Protocol, its architecture, and building MCP servers that connect AI applications to data sources and tools.

**Part 2: MCP Server Operator** - Bringing it all together by building a Kubernetes operator that manages MCP server deployments, making them enterprise-ready.

By the end, you'll have:
- Built and deployed MCP servers that integrate with LLMs
- Created a complete operator for managing MCP server lifecycles
- Understood production considerations for AI infrastructure

This lab bridges the gap between AI tooling and cloud-native infrastructure. Let's get started!
