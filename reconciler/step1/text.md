# Step 1: Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Welcome to the first step of our journey! In this step, we'll understand what MCP is, why it matters, and how it enables AI applications to connect with real-world systems.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI applications to connect securely with external data sources, tools, and services. Think of it as "USB for AI integrations" - it provides a standardized way for AI models to access context from your systems.

## The Problem MCP Solves

Before MCP, if you had M different AI applications and N different tools/systems, you'd need M×N different integrations:

```
AI App 1 ←→ Tool 1
AI App 1 ←→ Tool 2
AI App 2 ←→ Tool 1
AI App 2 ←→ Tool 2
... (complex web of integrations)
```

MCP transforms this into an "M+N problem":

```
AI Apps ←→ MCP Protocol ←→ MCP Servers ←→ Tools/Systems
```

## MCP Architecture

MCP follows a client-server architecture:

- **MCP Host**: The AI application (Claude, VS Code, ChatGPT) that coordinates multiple MCP clients
- **MCP Client**: Maintains a connection to an MCP server and obtains context
- **MCP Server**: Provides context, tools, and capabilities to MCP clients

## Core MCP Primitives

MCP servers expose three fundamental building blocks:

1. **Resources** - Structured data or content (like GET endpoints)
2. **Tools** - Executable functions that perform actions (like POST endpoints) 
3. **Prompts** - Pre-defined templates for AI interactions

Let's see this in action by exploring some real examples:

```bash
# Look at the MCP ecosystem
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/main/README.md | head -30
```{{exec}}

## Why MCP Matters for Kubernetes

MCP enables AI applications to:
- Query Kubernetes cluster state
- Deploy and manage workloads
- Troubleshoot issues with context
- Automate operations based on cluster events

In this tutorial, we'll build an operator that makes MCP servers first-class citizens in Kubernetes!

Next, let's dive deeper into MCP's building blocks.
