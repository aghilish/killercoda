# Step 11: Testing and Production Considerations

In this final step, we'll test our MCPServer operator and discuss production deployment considerations. This is where we ensure our operator is reliable, secure, and ready for real-world usage.

## Testing the Operator

Let's test our MCPServer operator end-to-end:

```bash
cd /workspace/mcp-operator

# Run the operator locally
echo "🚀 Starting MCPServer operator..."
make run &
OPERATOR_PID=$!

# Wait for operator to start
sleep 5

echo "✅ Operator started with PID: $OPERATOR_PID"
```{{exec}}

## Deploy Test MCPServer

```bash
# Apply the sample MCPServer
kubectl apply -f config/samples/mcp_v1alpha1_mcpserver.yaml

# Wait for resources to be created
sleep 10

echo "📊 Checking MCPServer status:"
kubectl get mcpservers

echo ""
echo "🚀 Checking created Deployment:"
kubectl get deployment example-mcpserver

echo ""
echo "🌐 Checking created Service:"
kubectl get service example-mcpserver

echo ""
echo "📋 Detailed MCPServer status:"
kubectl describe mcpserver example-mcpserver
```{{exec}}

## Test MCP Server Connectivity

```bash
# Test if our MCP server is responding
echo "🔍 Testing MCP server connectivity..."

# Port forward to test the service
kubectl port-forward service/example-mcpserver 8080:8080 &
PORT_FORWARD_PID=$!

sleep 3

# Test basic HTTP connectivity
echo "📡 Testing HTTP endpoint:"
curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || echo "Health check endpoint not responding (expected for basic Node.js image)"

# Cleanup port forward
kill $PORT_FORWARD_PID 2>/dev/null
```{{exec}}

## Test Reconciliation and Self-Healing

```bash
echo "🧪 Testing self-healing capabilities..."

# Delete the deployment (should be recreated by operator)
kubectl delete deployment example-mcpserver

echo "⏱️  Waiting for operator to recreate deployment..."
sleep 10

echo "🔄 Checking if deployment was recreated:"
kubectl get deployment example-mcpserver

echo ""
echo "📊 Checking pods:"
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=example-mcpserver
```{{exec}}

## Test Cleanup and Finalizers

```bash
echo "🧹 Testing cleanup with finalizers..."

# Delete the MCPServer (should trigger finalizer cleanup)
kubectl delete mcpserver example-mcpserver

echo "⏱️  Monitoring deletion process..."
sleep 5

# Check if resources are being cleaned up
echo "📊 Checking resource cleanup:"
kubectl get mcpserver example-mcpserver 2>/dev/null || echo "✅ MCPServer deleted"
kubectl get deployment example-mcpserver 2>/dev/null || echo "✅ Deployment cleaned up"
kubectl get service example-mcpserver 2>/dev/null || echo "✅ Service cleaned up"

# Stop the operator
kill $OPERATOR_PID 2>/dev/null
```{{exec}}

## Production Deployment Preparation
